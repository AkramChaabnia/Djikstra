## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The objective of this project is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, considering edge weights.

## üöÄ Code Structure <a name = "code_structure"></a>

The project includes the following files:

- `App.java`: Contains the main algorithm that computes the minimal weight path using Dijkstra's algorithm.

  - `Dijkstra(Graph graph, int start, int end, int numberV)`: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
  - `main` : method serves as the entry point for the application. It interacts with the user through the console to input the graph's details, such as the number of vertices, edges, their weights, starting node, and ending node. Once the inputs are collected, it calls the `Dijkstra` method to compute and display the minimal weight path between the specified nodes.

- `WeightedGraph.java`: Defines classes for representing a weighted graph, including vertices and edges.

## üìà Algorithm Complexity <a name="algorithm_complexity"></a>

The complexity of the algorithm used to determine the minimal weight path using Dijkstra's algorithm depends on the number of vertices (V) and edges (E) in the graph. In this context, it exhibits a complexity of **O(V _ (V + E) _ log V)**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

To run the project, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from [here](https://www.java.com/).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To compile and execute the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

### Using an IDE (Eclipse, VSCode, etc.)

2. Set up the JavaFX environment in your IDE.
3. Run the `App.java` file.

### Using Command Line

2. Compile the Java code using the command: `javac App.java`.
3. Run the compiled code using the command: `java App`.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To utilize the project:

- Input the number of vertices and edges.
- Enter the edges in the format: source destination weight. Enter `-1` to stop.
- Provide the starting and ending nodes.
- The project will compute and display the minimal weight path between the specified nodes.
